# Compression-Decompression-Huffman
The code is python based, it has to be run at a python IDE
input the file path as instructed by the guide print statements in the program
the output compressed and decompressed file has a path as the same place the code is for the sake of making it simple as reading a path from the user in python will require further parsing which might be complicated due to the necessity of adding the letter r before the path.

You have to Compress the file first then decode it; the program is not guranteed to work if another code compressed file.

Another important aspect of the debate is whether in principal there exists a conflict between holding a religious belief and studying an academic major at the university. To answer this, Ecklund et al. (2011) interviewed 275 professors to ask those renown professors about when they consider religion and science in conflict. He found that 15% of the sample said that it has been always the case of religion and science being in conflict. However, 15% said that there is no conflict. The rest 70% said that sometimes there exists some conflict. They concluded that religion and academic fields have a kind of an intrinsic conflict in the way they deal with the same topics. However, it is clear that their sample is small and can draw conclusions about specific science major experts only. In other words, it may be the case that other specialists and the public will see no conflict. In fact, Ecklund and Park (2009) showed that when they investigated surveys with a total of 1646 professor that were done over years to see whether professors really see a conflict between science and religion and the other factors that may affect their religious beliefs other than being scientists. Their finding was that the majority did not see conflicts in science and religion. Indeed, only 37% answered positively that a conflict exists. Needless to say, both studies can not represent the general public since their samples were meant to represent the science community. Nevertheless, they give some insights that this conflict is only likely in a very specific context like the case of few fields inside natural sciences like the theory of evolution in Biology and so on. In conclusion, saying that there is a conflict in general is not likely to be true. 

 
The last aspect of this interesting debate is the effect of religious beliefs in the education process itself. Literature seems to think that religion affects the educational process negatively. Liu et al. (2018) analysed data collected by the World Values Survey and the Global Creativity Index from 87 countries to investigate the correlation between creativity and religion in different countries. Their finding was that, in general, religiosity was associated negatively with the level of creativity, critical thinking and IQ. Along the same line, Brock (2009) investigated 1477 cases reported by the FBI, mainly hate crimes, to look at the religious beliefs and its effect the discrimination of minority groups in public schools that follow certain religious affiliation. She found out that a lot of discrimination happens in public schools that enforce religious education on their students.  However, there are some limitations of both studies. First, the sample did not represent all religions; in fact, most of the sample were Christians. Therefore, it is not safe to draw conclusions about the concept of religions in general. Second, both studies did not account for other social and economic factors that might be the causes for such results. Third, making a conclusion on religion based on the behaviour of individuals can be very tricky because it is hard to tell whether this person can model the general trend in his religion or not. For example, if a Muslim is a terrorist, that does not imply that he is a terrorist because his religion tells him to, and of course, there will be a lot of Muslims that are not terrorists. The same idea applies for the two studies; in the end, it is very difficult to judge a religion based on individualistic behaviours because religion interpretations can be very vague, and the individualistic behaviour may be irrelevant to the religion.
Education is becoming more and more influential in the lives of people as it promotes critical thinking about every belief one has. Therefore, it may impact directly what they have been taking for granted all along like religion. Hence, the effect of education on religion must be well identified in order to be able to understand and evaluate the beliefs each one has concerning religion. This issue has been investigated for many years, and the general trend when it comes to this field of research is that there is a negative correlation between holding strong religious beliefs and high-quality education from many aspects (Ecklund &Scheitle, 20007; Voas, 2014). Researchers tried to attribute that trend to that conflicts exist between science and religion (Ecklund et al. 2011) and that religious ideologies negatively affect the quality of education (Liu et al. 2018). The purpose of this paper is to shed some light on this relation between education and religion in the context of college students at AUC. It is expected that the findings will be similar to the general trend in this matter. In an attempt to analyse and understand the different views presented in this issue, ten primary studies are summarized and critically evaluated.

In seeking to know the relation between academic education and religion, a negative correlation between education and religiousness was evident in many studies. Voas (2014) after surveying 1714 adults with an age of over 18 years old to investigate the relation of education and religious experiences and practices in Taiwan found that People with higher education (university or above) were found to be more likely not to have a religion compared to those who did not or those who were surveyed in earlier ages. Also, those with higher education were less likely to do prayers or religious practices, and less likely to find it important to have a religion; however, they were more likely to express interest in supernatural entities and phenomena. The limitation of this study is that it does not have enough sample size to make a safe generalization over the whole population of Taiwan. Additionally, these findings cannot be used to expect the correlation between religion and education in other places in the world because it -in the best case- can be applied to Taiwan only and it is not representative of many other places that are radically different from Taiwan. For example, Taiwan’s neighbours are -unlike Taiwan- religious countries, so a liberal country like Taiwan cannot expect or represent the population there. However, Hungerman (2014) did a very similar study to Voas with a much bigger sample and attained almost the same correlation. He analysed data of 755386 persons that was previously collected over 30 years by other studies in Canada. He concluded that every extra year a student spends in education makes it 4% more likely that he will have no religion. Again, Hungerman’s conclusion has the same limitation as Voas’ conclusion although it has significantly larger sample; it can only represent Canada and the region around it, and it cannot be used to judge any culture different from Canada.
Ecklund and Long (2011) and Ecklund and Scheitle (2007) sought to investigate the same topic but using a different approach; they interviewed and surveyed only college professors and scientists in order to find out the correlation between education and religion, and they also obtained a negative correlation. Ecklund and Scheitle (2007) analysed surveys of about 6000 professors that were conducted over years to correlate different fields of study with religious service attendance and beliefs. They found that 42% of Natural scientists attend religious practices while only about 20 -30% of social scientists do, which suggests that both natural and social science fields have correlation that is negative with religiousness. Their fellow researches Ecklund and Long (2011) interviewed 275 Scientists in-depth interviews in order to know how natural and social scientists perceive spirituality. They found out that about 60% described themselves as being agnostic or atheists. Even those who categorized themselves as religious reported weak religiousness and attending prayers, which also highlights the existence of a negative correlation between pursuing high education and being religious. Nonetheless, an obvious limitation here is that these studies were conducted in the United States and their sample were chosen from specific fields and specific institutions, so the results cannot safely be extended to other places in the world. Another limitation that is mentioned in both papers is that the scientific community cannot by any means represent the general public or the other academic communities. Therefore, these papers can only be used as a reference in a very specific context, namely the relation between science and religion in the scientific community. 
To the contrary, few studies found out that there is hardly any correlation between science and religionises. Routon and Walker (2015) collected from different sources -like Cooperative Institutional Research Program- a huge sample consisting of 141082 persons from 514 different institutes aiming to add some perspective to the education-religion debate. They did so by collecting huge database from different places over the world to consider different parameters that might add useful insights to the issue. Surprisingly, their paper did not report negative correlation between the education level and the level of spirituality in people's life. In fact, 56% of students report changes in the strength of their religious convictions during college, while 45% report changes in religious service attendance frequency. However, 33% turned from having no religion to having a religion throughout their college period, which might suggest that education is not the main factor that controls the religiosity of the person, but things like culture and background play the greatest role. Indeed, Mathur (2012) made a questionnaire for 201 people from the U.S. and 144 people from India to make a rigorous measurement scale for religiosity by comparing different samples from different cultures. Religiosity was found to have a great dependence on the culture itself. Although the second study has a very small sample, the point of strength both studies mentioned above has is that they investigate different samples from different places in the world, which eliminates the weakness that some studies had of not being able to represent diverse cultures. Maybe the only minor weakness that the first study has is that its sample was only college students only, which does not affect the credibility of the results since they can represent the population in religion-education debate. 

Another important aspect of the debate is whether in principal there exists a conflict between holding a religious belief and studying an academic major at the university. To answer this, Ecklund et al. (2011) interviewed 275 professors to ask those renown professors about when they consider religion and science in conflict. He found that 15% of the sample said that it has been always the case of religion and science being in conflict. However, 15% said that there is no conflict.

In fact, Ecklund and Park (2009) showed that when they investigated surveys with a total of 1646 professor that were done over years to see whether professors really see a conflict between science and religion and the other factors that may affect their religious beliefs other than being scientists.

Nevertheless, they give some insights that this conflict is only likely in a very specific context like the case of few fields inside natural sciences like the theory of evolution in Biology and so on. In conclusion, saying that there is a conflict in general is not likely to be true.

All in all, the education-religion debate has been a topic of importance to the academic researchers. Literature exposes three main aspect: religiousness and education, religion effect on education, and the conflict between religion and educational fields. As it is always the case in scientific research, there are paradoxical findings. Concerning the aspects of religiousness and education and the existence of a conflict between religion and different fields of study, some studies found out a negative correlation and some found out no correlation between science and religion. However, the aspect of religion effect on education had only negative correlation as a result coming from literature. The main limitations of the studies were small sample size and the sample being representative to a specific culture. In addition, literature provides almost no representation to the middle eastern societies. As a trial to fill this gap, this paper aims to represent the middle eastern communities by investigating a sample from the American University in Cairo, which contains many students from the middle east generally and from Egypt in particular, making its population capable of representing the middle eastern population. The specific topic of investigation on this population will be how does academic and specifically scientific education affect religiousness?
